If you run into any issues with the LRS not mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/Apereo-Learning-Analytics-Initiative/Larissa/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, please <a href="https://github.com/Apereo-Learning-Analytics-Initiative/Larissa/issues">report</a> them.

Please note that transport is non-secure so do not store sensitive information there. Also assume all other participants can see your entries anyway :-)

You can find assorted resources for working with the LRS at the <a href="http://tincanapi.com/page-developers/"> Tin Can API Developers page</a>. This includes client libraries for multiple programming languages.
